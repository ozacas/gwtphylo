	<p>
		<i>Java won't start?</i><br/>
		
		Check that you have java 7 or later installed into your browser. In the URL box, you 
		should see something like the image below when you put 'about:plugins' (without the quotes)
		into the URL box:
		<br/>
			<img src="/images/java_wont_start.png" alt="working java browser plugin image" />
		<br/>
		Remember that many browsers are only 32-bit even when installed on a 64-bit system, in which
		case you will need to install 32-bit java to match the browser. Be sure to install java with
		the browser closed, or results may be unpredictable.

		<i>Cannot see protein domains?</i><br/>
		
		In applet mode, the default size for the protein domains is too small to see. You need to 
		push the '+' button under the 'protein domains' section until the domains become visible.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<i>Branch widths not viewable?</i><br/>
		Not all of the available trees have branch widths to aid in visualisation of the major
		topologies. Consult the <a href="/methods.html">Methods page</a> for each gene family
		for more details
